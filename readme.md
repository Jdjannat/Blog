# JD Blog

This is a powerful blog, I try to build the blog more beautiful, more convenient. 

`Laravel 8.*` and `Vuejs 2.*` combined with the establishment of a good response and quickly dashboard, the dashboard made through the `Vuejs` component development.

I believe it will be better and better. If you are interested in this, you can join and enjoy it.
